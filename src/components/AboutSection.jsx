			<p className="font-[Nunito] text-darkGreen/70 tracking-wider text-sm md:text-base text-center mb-4">The application allows users to explore Studio Ghibli films by searching, filtering, and sorting titles based on different criteria, transforming a simple movie list into a more immersive and thoughtful discovery journey.</p>

			<p className="font-[Nunito] text-darkGreen/70 tracking-wider text-sm md:text-base text-center mb-4">Studio Ghibli is known for its emotionally rich storytelling, hand-crafted animation, and deep connection with nature, memory, and imagination. This project draws inspiration from those values, aiming to translate the studio’s poetic atmosphere into a digital interface that feels gentle, cinematic, and inviting.</p>
			<p className="font-[Nunito] text-darkGreen/70 tracking-wider text-sm md:text-base text-center">
			Beyond a tribute, Ghibli Explorer is also a technical exploration. It was designed to practice modern front-end development concepts such as component-based architecture, responsive layouts, state management, and user-focused interaction design — always balancing functionality with visual harmony.</p>
